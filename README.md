This repository contains all data and R-code to reproduce the analysis and simulations for the article entitled "Conceptualizing and quantifying body condition using structural equation modelling: A user guide" by the authors Magali Frauendorf, Andrew M. Allen, Simon Verhulst, Eelke Jongejans, Bruno J. Ens, HenkJan van der Kolk, Hans de Kroon, Jeroen Nienhuis & Martijn van de Pol, published in the Journal of Animal Ecology in 2021.

data.csv and dataCodeS11.csv are necessary for the Analysis.Rmd (also available as word document), which includes the codes for the main analysis of the paper (Fig. 2-6). 

data.csv together with the Simulation.Rmd is necessary to reproduce the simulation (shown in Fig. 7). Because running of the simulations may take long, the global environment is also available (Simulation.Rdata).
