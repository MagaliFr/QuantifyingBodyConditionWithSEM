# QuantifyingBodyConditionWithSEM
This repository contains all data and R-code to reproduce the analysis and simulations for the publication entitled "Conceptualizing and quantifying body condition using structural equation modelling: A user guide" by the authors Magali Frauendorf, Andrew M. Allen, Simon Verhulst, Eelke Jongejans, Bruno J. Ens, HenkJan van der Kolk, Hans de Kroon, Jeroen Nienhuis & Martijn van de Pol. 

data.csv and dataCodeS11.csv are necessary for the Analysis.Rmd (also available as word document), which includes the main analysis of the paper (Fig. 2-6). 

dataSimulation.csv together with the Simulation.Rmd is necessary to reproduce the simulation (shown in Fig. 7). Because running of the simulations may take long, the global environment is also available (Simulation.Rdata).
